MoBerries feed.me test

This is a test website called feed.me
It takes you through a flow of pizza order:
1. Select size, Ingredients & Cheese rand
2. Put in some personal details
3. Get an output of your order

What did I use:
Some bootstrap & media queries for the responsiveness.
AngularJS Front end MVC framework
ui-router for AngularJS


Todo:
- Get the api request running (activate an already exist function)
- Finalize
